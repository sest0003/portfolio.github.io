## Forget

In React we do things differently than in "vanilla" JavaScript

Don't use LiveServer (we will open the site with "npm start" instead)

Don't use selectors:
- document.querySelector
- document.querySelectorAll
- document.getElementById

Don't modify CSS-classes:
- element.classList.add
- element.classList.remove
