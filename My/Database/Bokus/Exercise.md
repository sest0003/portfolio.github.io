# Bokus

"Bokus" is an online shop for books. Each book is written by an author and has a title, number-of-pages and a weight (in gram). Some books have co-authors. A book has an ISBN number and is published on a specific date by a publishing company. Customers can login (loginname + password) and write reviews of books. They can also reserve many books (a customer may reserve many copies of the same book). On the site users will see reviews in chronological order. A book is published by a company, and we want to store their address, including country.
