# Online Pizza

We're going to build a database for a company that delivers pizzas. Here is what the database should store:

    Alice orders 2 Margaritas and 3 Fungi from Pizzeria Formaggio (Flemingsgatan 7, Stockholm). Note: "Make them vegan"

    Wilma orders 1 Fungi och 2 Vesuvio from Pizzeria Venedig  (Risbrinksgatan 4, Linköping). Note: "Not so much cheese". One of the Vesuvio should have pommes on top. The Fungi should be without cheese (shouldn't affect price)

    Lukas orders 1 Hawaii from Pizzeria Mini mac (Fjällgatan 28, Göteborg) with double dough and garlic sauce. 

    Alice placed the order 2023-02-10 12:00 and got it delivered 2023-02-10 12:25
    Wilma placed the order 2023-02-10 12:02 and got it delivered 2023-02-10 12:15
