Learn how to create an Entity Relationship Diagram in this tutorial. We provide a basic overview of ERDs and then gives step-by-step training on how to make an ER diagram with correct cardinality.

Entity Relationship Diagrams are comprised of 3 main categories: entities, attributes, and relationships. Entities are objects or concepts that are associated with important data‚Äîlike a customer, order, or product.  Attributes represent properties or traits of an entity, such as a customer‚Äôs phone number or home address. Relationships demonstrate the link between entities.

Another main aspect of of ERD's is cardinality, which further defines the relationship between entities in a numerical way. Certain symbols signify the minimum and maximum relationship between different entities.

Learn how to create an Entity Relationship Diagram with Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, and Composite Keys in this advanced ERD tutorial. We provide step-by-step training on how to identify these different keys, as well as helpful information on bridge tables, data types, and how your ER Diagram relates to a database management system.

A Primary Key is an attribute (or field) that uniquely identifies every record in a certain table. There‚Äôs one Primary Key per entity, and they must be unique, never-changing, and never-null. You note a Primary Key in your Entity Relationship Diagram with ‚ÄúPK‚Äù to the left of the appropriate attribute.

A Foreign Key is an attribute in one entity that links to the Primary Key of another entity. Consequently, they enable relationships between those entities. There can be multiple foreign keys per entity, or none at all. You note a Foreign Key in your ERD with ‚ÄúFK‚Äù to the left of the appropriate attributes.
